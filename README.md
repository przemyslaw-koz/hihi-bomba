# Hihi Bomba 💣

This is a fun little web project created together with my kids — just for laughs and learning.
It features a bouncing cartoon character and laugh audio.

The project is also used as a base for experimenting with:
- **Cloudflare Tunnels** (secure public access),
- **Umami Analytics** (privacy-friendly tracking),
- **Ansible Automation** (infra-as-code),
- and general **DevOps best practices**.

Deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), with automatic builds on every push.

Made by **Julek 💣** and **Janek 🏠** with my small help.
